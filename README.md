# Rust implementation for Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) challenges, implemented in Rust. Each day's challenge is implemented in its own module within the `src` directory.

To run the solutions, use Cargo:

```bash
cargo run <day_x>  # Replace <day_x> with the desired day, e.g., day_01
```

To run second task for a day, use the `--second` flag:

```bash
cargo run -- -s <day_x>  # Replace <day_x> with the desired day, e.g., day_01
```

You can also run with test input using the `--test` flag:

```bash
cargo run -- -t <day_x>  # Replace <day_x> with the desired day, e.g., day_01
```
